A PHP script to download Adobe HDS streams. Forked from K-S-V.


Added Features
--------------
In addition to the original features, this fork also supports the following features:

- Ability to specify `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header. (--forwarded)


Removed Features
----------------

- Ability to update the script using the script. I consider it a security risk.
